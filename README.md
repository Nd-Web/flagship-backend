# Flagship Backend Project

A backend project built step by step using a **senior-engineer mindset**.
The goal is to deeply understand backend fundamentals while building a
realistic, scalable foundation for future production systems.

---

## Tech Stack (So Far)

- Python 3
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- Uvicorn
- Git & GitHub
- In-memory data storage (temporary)

---

## Current Features

### ✅ Server & Routing
- FastAPI server running locally
- Automatic API documentation via `/docs`
- Health check endpoint

### ✅ Data Handling & Validation
- POST request handling
- Request body validation using Pydantic
- Automatic error responses (422 validation errors)

### ✅ State & Persistence (In-Memory)
- Users can be created and stored while the server is running
- Users can be retrieved via a list endpoint
- IDs are generated by the backend

---

## API Endpoints

### GET `/health`
Health check endpoint to verify the server is running.

**Response**
```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}

## Architecture
The backend is structured using separation of concerns:
- `api/` – HTTP routes
- `schemas/` – request/response models
- `services/` – business logic
- `main.py` – application setup
